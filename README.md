# survey_business_owners
Project for Data Visualization

The Survey of Small Business Owners presentation was a project for my Data Visualization course as part of the UTSA Masters in Data Analytics program. 
The project consisted of the following: 



* Collaborated on a team of 3 analyzing datasets from the US Censusâ€™s Survey of Business Owners using R and RStudio
* Analyzed different variables such as gender, race, and education to give a historical overview on the economic and social characteristics of US business owners
* Presented our findings utilizing ggplot graphs, high charter maps, and HTML through revealJS
